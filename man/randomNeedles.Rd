\title{Simulate fine needle aspiration}
\usage{
randomNeedles(tumor, nsamples, threshold = 0.05, depth = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{tumor}{A list which is the output of \code{\link{simulateTumor}()}.}

\item{nsamples}{The number of samples to take.}

\item{threshold}{Only mutations with an allele frequency greater than the threshold will be included in the sample.}
}
\description{
Simulate a sampling procedure which takes a fine needle through the simulated tumor and
reports the mutation allele frequency of the sampled cells.
}
\details{
This sampling procedure is inspired by Chkhaidze et. al. (2019) and simulates 
fine needle aspiration. A random one-dimensional cross-section 
of the tumor is chosen, and the cells within this cross section are sampled, reporting mutation allele frequency.

\examples{
out <- simulateTumor(N = 1000)
df <- randomNeedles(tumor = out, nsamples = 5)
