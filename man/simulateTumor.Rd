\usage{
simulateTumor(
  N = 250000,
  b = 0.25,
  d = 0.18,
  u = 0.01,
  du = 0.003,
  s = 1.05,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Number of cells in the tumor.}

\item{b}{Cell division rate.}

\item{d}{Cell death rate.}

\item{u}{Mutation rate. When a cell divides, both daughter cell acquire \eqn{Pois(u)} genetic alterations}

\item{du}{The probability that a genetic alteration is a driver mutation.}

\item{s}{The selective advantage conferred to a driver mutation. A cell with k
driver mutations is given birth rate \eqn{bs^k}.}

\item{verbose}{Whether or not to print simulation details to the R console.}
}
\value{
A list with components 
\itemize{
\item \code{cell_ids} - A data frame containing the information for the simulated cells. (x,y,z) position, allele ID number
(note that 0 is the wild-type allele),
number of genetic alterations, and Euclidean distance from origin are included. 
\item \code{muts} - A data frame consisting of the mutation ID number, the count of the mutation within the population, 
and the mutation allele frequency (which is the count divided by N). 
\item \code{phylo_tree} - A data frame giving all of the information necessary to determine the order of mutations. The parent
of a mutation is defined to be the most recent mutation that precedes it. Since the ID 0 corresponds to the initial mutation,
0 does not have any parents and is thus the root of the tree. 
\item \code{alleles} - A data frame containing the information about the mutations that make up each allele. The \eqn{i}-th 
row of this data frame corresponds to the allele ID \eqn{i-1}. The positive numbers in each row correspond to the IDs of the 
mutations present in that allele, while a -1 is simply a placeholder and indicates no mutation. The count column gives
the number of cells which have the specific allele. 
\item \code{color_scheme} - A vector containing an assignment of a color to each allele.
\item \code{drivers} - A vector containing the ID numbers for the driver mutations.
\item \code{time} - The simulated time (in days). 
\item \code{params} - The parameters used for the simulation.

\description{
Simulate the spatial growth of a tumor with a multi-type branching
process on the three-dimensional integer lattice.
}
\details{
The model is based upon Waclaw et. al. (2015), although the simulation algorithm used is different. A growth of a canerous tumor
is modeled using an exponential birth-death process on the three-dimensional integer lattice. Each cell is given a birth rate
\eqn{b} and a death rate \eqn{d} such that the time until cell division or cell death is exponentially distributed with 
parameters \eqn{b} and \eqn{d}, respectively. A cell can replicate if at least one of the six sites adjacent to it is
unoccupied. Each time cell replication occurs, both daughter cells recevie \eqn{Pois(u)} genetic alterations. Each 
alteration is a driver mutation with some probability \eqn{du}. A cell with k driver mutations is given birth rate 
\eqn{bs^k}. The simulation begins with a single cell at the origin at time \eqn{t = 0}. 

The model is simulated using a Gillespie algorithm. MAYBE WRITE A LTITLE MORE
