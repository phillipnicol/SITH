Title: A Spatial Model of Intra-Tumor Heterogeneity
Version: 1.0.1.1
Date: 2020-07-01
Author: Phillip B. Nicol

Description: Implements a three-dimensional stochastic model of cancer growth and mutation similar to the one described in Waclaw et al. (2015) <doi:10.1038/nature14971>. Allows for interactive 3D visualizations of the simulated tumor. Provides a comprehensive summary of the spatial distribution of mutants within the tumor. Contains functions which create synthetic sequencing datasets from the generated tumor.
